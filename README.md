The Caelum is heavily forked from the Lagrange keyboard. Check out the idea and the implementation from the repository. Caelum means sky. Caelum layout is inspired by planck.

If you want to build your own Caelum, you can find detailed
instructions for the lagrange keyboard as reference in [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).
